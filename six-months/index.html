                        <p>When asked to produce a showcase of the creative work I did as part of my internship here at the Institute, for the longest time I was unsure of what to do. Most of the outcomes I had produced weren't all that nice to look at, and a lot of the evidence of my process was locked up in hundreds of lines of code.</p>
                        <p>Instead I ended up with this machine, with the hope of being able to recreate the atmosphere of experimentation and discovery that was a hallmark of my time here.</p>
                        <p>Much like this machine, I started without really knowing what my final output would be, and without much experience working creatively. But as I researched (as you can do with this browser) and experiented (with a console much like the one in Terminal C) I was able to produce outputs I never thought I would.</p>
                        <p>And as my time at the Institute was limited, so is your time with the machine.</p>
                        <p>Make cool sh*t.</p>

                        <p>Inspired by several talks by Zach Liebermann and Processing by Casey Reas and Ben Fry, the first portion of my time as an intern at the lab was experimenting with code sketches. As the name suggests, these were small programs often based on whatever inspiration I found while doing other work or just from around the studio. Some of the inspirations for my sketches included:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Brutalism architecture</li>
                            <li>20th century loom weaving diagrams</li>
                            <li>Autonomous agents</li>
                            <li>VHS players</li>
                            <li>Bookshelves</li>
                            <li>Bugs that occured during other sketches</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>While not all of these yielded interesting results, a selection of my sketches can be found below. Initially I was considering using Processing as that was the book that had put me onto creative coding as an idea, I eventually settled on using p5.js as my medium due to the added ease of sharing my sketches over the internet.</p>

                        <p>One of my earliest sketches, this was my first sketch that I felt touched the potential of computer controlled visuals. The foundations of the sketch are the 'sigil' shapes, which are built from a number of bezier curves. When the computer gets 50% along the way of a curve, it creates a new sigil centred on that point, with one fewer curves than the sigil it is currently drawing. So a 5 sided sigil produces 5 4 sided sigils, which each produce 4 3 sided sigils and so on.</p>
                        <p>As all the points are generated by the computer, they can be individually manipulated. The second half of the video below shows the points being randomised.</p>

                        <h1>Ecosystem</h1>
                        <p>The inspiration for Ecosystem came from a module in the second year of my degree called Autonomous Agents. The eponymous concept refers to anything that is able to perceive its environment and then take actions using what it ‘sees’ according to an internal logic, without the assistance or guidance from another agent. It’s a broad term and both people and thermostats could be considered autonomous agents. I was interested in seeing how I could use a system of agents to produce a visual.</p>
                        <p>A lot of the module talked about biological inspirations for algorithms, so I used that as a starting point with a basic predator & prey scenario. The predator agents in red try to chase down the prey agents in blue before their internal timer runs out, while the prey agents want to both move towards the green ‘plant’ objects while also avoiding the predator agents.</p>

                        <p>Following on from Ecosystem, the sketch inspired by autonomous agents, I was looking for alternative visuals I could apply the logic to. My inspiration came as I was flicking through some of the books in the studio and I found ‘Carpets of the Art Deco Era’ by Susan Day. In particular I really enjoyed the texture of the diagrams used for old looms and my thoughts went to how I could possibly use the logic of the autonomous agents to generate new ‘diagrams’. </p>
                        <p>In the sketch that came out of it, most of my effort was spent replicating the visual look of the strings and the actual logic underneath it sort of fell by the wayside, which was a shame. In my efforts to create the rope aesthetic, I did end up having several bugs which themselves produced an interesting visual, which I then tweaked as sketches by themselves.</p>

                        <p>An early trial within a 3d enviroment. I wanted to try creating something with an immersive feel and so chose a subject with a first person view inspired by the real world.</p>
                        <p>I ended up using 2d sprites both to avoid spending too much time learning how to use models but also because I enjoyed the aesthetic of 2d sprites in the 2d enviroment.</p>
                        <p>This sketch ended taking up more time than expected due to the number of times I had to rework the framework of my code. The large number of sprites could easily cause performance issues if manipulated carelessly.</p>

                        <p>'Polygons' was the second ever sketch I made with p5.js and like with the other sketches I made early on I was less concerned with the end output and more on the novelty of using the maths I'd spent the last 7 years learning creatively!</p>
                        <p>These early learning sketches also usually allowed for some more of user input, whether thath be drawing shapes or having options for numbers of inputs, but as my later sketches shifted more towards trying to produce a specific visual, I found myself removing the interactive elements in order to maintain as much control over the end results as possible.</p>

                        <p>It was as I was adding rotation and translation effects to the 'Sigil' sketch that I realised that I had essentially ended up with a spirograph machine. So I thought it would be fun to make a version of the sketch that would randomise the various input variables and produce large images of the results.</p>
                        <p>Out of the 100+ inputs produced, I found that most of them fell into 6 pattern types: 'meshes', 'looney tunes', 'black holes', 'sun rays', 'cones' and 'tubes'. The video below shows of each of these types as well as a few curious outliers.</p>

                        <p>This sketch started off with a selection of symbols that were shown to me by Guy, one of the people who runs the Institute Research Lab here. The symbols were being used as part of an identity for a brand and he wanted to see what I could do with them.</p>
                        <p>My process started with me working out to break down the natural, handdrawn shapes intro something I could get the computer to replicate. I was fascinated with the way I could create a fascimile a handdrawn shape by adding a noise function to the position of the 'pen' as it drew out the shape.</p>
                        <p>Eventually I added more and more functionalty to my representation of the shape and as I did I found inspiration for several other sketches that could use the same shape. Some of these turned into the sketches 'Spraypaint' and 'Spiral'.</p>

                        <p>This sketch in particular occured whilst I was creating the 'Weave' sketch, I had created the rope-esque visuals I was looking for but hadn't quite managed to get the ropes to curl around properly.

                        <p>Processing and p5.js are programming languages that were created with the intention of being used for the visual arts and design. They have become popular because of their ability to create visually appealing applications that are also interactive and engaging for the user.</p>
                        <p>Processing was initially developed by two individuals, Ben Fry and Casey Reas, back in 2001. In 2014, Lauren McCarthy developed p5.js as a web-based alternative to Processing. The library was designed to run within a browser, making it easily accessible to anyone with an internet connection. Since then, p5.js has become increasingly popular for its simplicity and ease of use.</p>
                        <p>While Processing and p5.js are different programming languages, they share many similarities in syntax and functionality. In fact, p5.js was designed to be similar to Processing, making it easy for users to switch between the two.</p>
