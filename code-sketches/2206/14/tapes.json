Each strand of the weave is an autonomous agent looking for 'food' in order to keep itself alive. The food nodes are indicated by the dots. \nThe design itself was inspired by art deco carpet weaving patterns and wondering how I could recreate those textures computationally. \nInterestingly I found myself removing more and more of the 'intelligence' of the underlying program in pursuit of creating more aesthetically pleasing outcomes. In this model the agents are unlikely to die and there is no threat of predators, meaning they soley move towards the closest fully grown food node.",
